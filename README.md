# Kubernetes CNI Implementation with Golang

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin using Golang. The project focuses on utilizing bridge-based routing for networking within Kubernetes clusters. The CNI plugin is responsible for configuring network interfaces and routes for containers running on Kubernetes nodes, enabling seamless communication between pods across the cluster.

## Key Features
- **Bridge-Based Routing:** Implements bridge-based routing for network communication between pods within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Network Interface Configuration:** Configures network interfaces for containers running on Kubernetes nodes.
- **Route Management:** Manages routing tables to ensure efficient packet forwarding between pods.
- **IP Address Allocation:** Allocates IP addresses to containers dynamically to facilitate network communication.
- **Integration with Kubernetes:** Integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes as a CNI plugin to provide networking capabilities for pods.
- **Scalability:** Designed for scalability to support large-scale Kubernetes deployments with thousands of pods.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimizes network performance through efficient routing and packet forwarding mechanisms.
- **Security:** Implements security measures to ensure network isolation and prevent unauthorized access to pod communication channels.

## Technologies Used
- **Golang:** A statically typed, compiled programming language used for building efficient and scalable applications.
- **Kubernetes CNI Specification:** Adheres to the Kubernetes CNI specification for seamless integration with Kubernetes clusters.
- **Linux Networking:** Utilizes Linux networking stack for configuring network interfaces, routes, and packet forwarding.
- **Docker:** Used for containerization of the CNI plugin to ensure portability and ease of deployment.
- **Bridge-Based Networking:** Implements bridge-based networking for creating virtual bridges and connecting containers within the same network segment.
- **RESTful API:** Provides a RESTful API for managing network configuration and operations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the CNI plugin using the provided build instructions or Dockerfile.
3. Deploy the CNI plugin on Kubernetes nodes using the appropriate deployment method.
4. Verify the functionality of the CNI plugin by deploying pods and testing network communication between them.
5. Monitor network performance and troubleshoot any issues using Kubernetes and CNI plugin logs.
